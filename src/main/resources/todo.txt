BossShop:
* Add support for different spawn-egg types
* Move BSBuy code into the different enums. New methods that enums should have:
**transformReward/transformPrice (transforms it into nice string to display)
**hasPrice (only for prices)
**takePrice (only for prices)
**giveReward (only for rewards)
therefor, create new helper classes that do stuff like giving rewards



BS-SingleUse:
* UUID support
* Optional Uses-reset after every day/week/month
